  <string id="str_quest_tor_engineer.cultistReturn1" text= "{=!}I see, this is not what I had hoped for. Were there any further clues, did you interrogate these scoundrels?"/>
  <string id="str_quest_tor_engineer.cultistReturn2" text= "{=!}One of the bandits did mention a name, {ROGUE_ENGINEER_NAME} I think?"/>
  <string id="str_quest_tor_engineer.cultistReturn3" text="{=!}Blast! I should have known. If you are willing, I would ask for your assistance once more.

  <string id="str_quest_tor_engineer.rogueEngineerQuestStart" text="{=!}If he has stolen these parts, it can only be for something heinous. I must ask that you track him down, and put an end to whatever madness he is trying to concoct. Will you do this?"/>

  <!-- Religions -->
  <string id="tor_religion_description.cult_of_sigmar" text="{=!}The Cult of Sigmar, also sometimes called the Church of Sigmar, the Holy Temple of Sigmar, the Clergy of Sigmar or simply the Sigmarite Cult, is the state church of the Empire that administrates the worship of that realm's patron god, Sigmar Heldenhammer. The Cult of Sigmar was founded by the wild-eyed friar Johann Helstrum in the year 73 IC, when he appeared before the masses to relate a vision that he experienced of Sigmar kneeling before Ulric, the god of war and winter, who placed the crown of godhood upon his brow as Sigmar took his place amongst the deities of the Old World Pantheon. As of today, the Cult of Sigmar has become an essential part of Imperial society. Nearly every city, town or village within the Empire has dedicated a portion of their wealth and land to the creation and maintenance of a Sigmarite temple, from which a priest of the Cult of Sigmar will attend to the spiritual well-being of its citizenry, whether it be through holy words of prayer or through heroic actions and trials by combat." />
  <string id="tor_religion_description.cult_of_taal" text="{=!}The Cult of Taal and Rhya is among the most ancient and pervasive in the Old World, tracing a direct line to the primal gods from the deepest of history. The cult grew organically, as early Humans tried to explain natural phenomenon, such as thunder, the turning of the seasons, and the rise and ebb of the seas. Over time, the Gods Taal and Rhya came into being, beginning as a single entity, known as Ishnernos. This split occurred many thousands of years ago, and the Cult of Ishnernos faded into distant memory. Taal rules nature and is considered King of the Gods. He claims the wild places as his domain and is primarily worshipped by hardy woodsmen, trackers, and rangers. Rhya's worshippers are found in the cultivated fields and orchards of the Empire, and are found among farmers, fishermen, and young lovers everywhere. The Cult of Taal and Rhya is the sanctioned cult of Talabecland, and is wildly popular in the eastern and northern parts of the Empire. Of the two, Taal receives most recognition, and Rhya's role is much diminished. The grand city of Talabheim is particularly fervent in its worship of both Taal and Rhya. However, in other cities, although Rhya's name is commonly known, he worship is rare, leading many urbanites to conclude that her cult is on the decline." />
