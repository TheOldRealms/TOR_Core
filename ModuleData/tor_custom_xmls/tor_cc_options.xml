		<OptionFlavourText>You parents were of the ‘Nobility’ in Mousillon, if they can be called that. Nobles here are mostly made up of outlawed Bretonnian nobles, exiles and rouges from other nations, vampires, mummies and other varied monstrosities. While certainly at the top of Mousillan society, outside of the blighted land they are looked down upon the same as anyone else from here. </OptionFlavourText>
