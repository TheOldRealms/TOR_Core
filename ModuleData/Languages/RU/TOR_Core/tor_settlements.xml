	<!--settlement descriptions / описания поселений-->
	
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.town_AV1" text="Averheim, the capital of the Grand Province of Averland, is one of the oldest cities in the Empire. The site upon which the modern city now lies has been occupied since before the time of Sigmar when the Averlanders were still called Brigrundians. The dockyards here are particularly bustling due to the Aver serving as the primary trade route for the Halfling goods from the Moot into the wider empire. The bluff that the city sits upon protects the inhabitants from occasional flooding and has always served as an ideal crossing point across the Aver River; making the Griffin bridge one of the only places for many miles which provides access across the river for merchants and travellers heading north into Stirland or south into Averland. The skyline of the city is dominated by the Averburg Palace, a formidable fortress originally built around the founding of the Empire; views of the surrounding lands from the palace go for several miles all around the city. The city is famous for its cattle stockyards, the final destination of thousands of Averland cattle, the Plenzerplatz and of course its lord; Marious Lietdorf, the mad count of Averland." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV1_1" text="Located just down river from the confluence of the rivers Aver and Lammer, the town of Streissen is known for its revolutionary spirit and volatile past. The town hosts a small university and medical school, infamous for producing pupils who do not abide by the old ways. Streissen once held its own town charter, granting many tax exemptions and the ability to elect its own leaders, but this was revoked in a deal with the Countess Ludmilla Alptraum who saved the town from a student-led revolution. The university continues to operate with the memory of the purge following the Alptraum’s violent suppression still fresh in most residents’ minds. A ferry providing access across the Aver operates here." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV1_2" text="Lengenfeld serves as the primary holding of Countess Carmilla von Sachs. The people here fish the river Aver for sustenance, drying and trading the rest along with their cattle to create wealth. A ferry here is also maintained to facilitate travel and trade across the Aver, a tax is collected for their lord." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV1_3" text="On the western border of the Wailing Woods is the village of Bieswang. The people here survive off of what they can grow and trade to purchase what they cannot. Unlike most Averlanders, their proximity to a supposedly cursed wood has made the lot of them superstitious; newcomers may be hard pressed to earn their trust." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV1_4" text="Sat on the crossroads of the Old Dwarf Road, the town of Heideck was originally constructed by the Dwarfs during the height of their kingdoms several millennia ago. The few still-standing dwarf structures remain in use by the humans here, a living testament to the architectural standards of the elder race. Below Heideck is rumoured to be many dwarf catacombs, filled with ancient treasure and artefacts just waiting to be unsealed and taken." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_AV2" text="Wuppertal is a picturesque Averlandish town, some might even say frozen in its cherished past. The city is known for carpentry, fine beer and ale (by human standards) and its tradition abiding Averlander inhabitants. The town also hosts many pilgrims and zealots, serving as one of the southern strongholds for the cult of Sigmar whose shrine here is dedicated to Joseph the Reverent. The town also hosts a large temple of Verena and a Garden of Morr. As with many settlements along the Upper Reik, a ferry operates to bring goods and people across the river into Averland or out to Wissenland." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_AV2_1" text="Surrounded by a ditch and a stone palisade is the town of Colmfӓhre. This is a modest town and is ruled by Baron Sigmund Hindenberg, who maintains his vigil over the settlement and the surrounding area from Castle Hindenburg, situated on a nearby hill. A ferry serves travellers seeking to cross the Reik river, heading south into Wissenland or north into Averland." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_AV2_2" text="As a small town in southern Averland, Loningbruck serves as a crucial stop for merchants travelling along the Reik, either downriver towards Marienburg and the Great Ocean or upriver to the Dwarfen Kingdoms. One of the only roads leading to and from the Blackfire Pass also passes through Loningbruck. As a result of these mercantile interests, the town’s economy relies on the trade these routes bring, supplemented only by the sale of cattle. The town is dominated by The Crossed Keys, a large coaching inn, and the temple of Verena, the largest temple in town. Loningbruck unfortunatly also lends its name to Loningbruck Ruby, a infamously low-quality type of wine." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_AV2_3" text="Home to the Baroness Alder, the unassuming village of Bernloch is most famous for its Bernloch Hard Cheese. The people here mostly raise goats for both their meat and their cheese, as well as facilitate trade along the Agbeiten-Heideck Road." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.town_AV3" text="The fortress town of Grenzstadt guards the approaches to and from the infamous Black Fire Pass. The Old Dwarf Road also passes through it on its northern route. As a result of its geography the town is in the perfect position to both facilitate trade with the Dwarfen Karaks and to guard against invasion by Greenskins and similar ilk coming through the Black Fire Pass. Tall and formidable walls and towers, and the size of its merchant quarter, enlarge the true size of the town. On any given day there are typically more visitors in the town than permanent inhabitants. Of these inhabitants, 1/10th of them are Dwarfs, here to serve as agents for their clans and to watch for human thieves seeking to sell stolen dwarf artefacts in the Empire. It is also known for Grenzstadter wine, high quality wine known for causing little to no hangover effects." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV3_1" text="The docks here at Hochsleben mark the end of the Upper Reik for boat traffic. While the river continues higher into the mountains for many miles, past this point the rapids, falls and ascent becomes far too dangerous for travel. As a result the town typically hosts a number of boats and ships, all plying their trade in goods going to or coming from the World’s edge mountains." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV3_2" text="Agbeiten is a large village that serves as both a mercantile and religious hub in Southern Averland. The Taalebenplatz, the centre of Agbeiten, is a large square where Agbeiten holds its daily market located at the crossroads of the Loningbruck-Hochsleben and Heideck Roads. On the northern end of the square are shrines to Sigmar, Ulric, and Verena. The round, timberbuilt Temple of Taal and Rhya is one of the largest in the Southern Empire and one of the few located within the stone walls of a town. The people of Agbeiten are mostly followers of Taal and Rhya." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_AV4" text="On the eastern border of Averland stands Pfungzig, a fortress and seat of power belonging to von Heine. Pfungzig commands a view of many miles around it, allowing one to watch over a large stretch of the Blue Reach, the southern Wailing Woods and Southern Stirland. While no bridge stands here to cross the nearby river, the fortress maintains a ferry for those with crowns who wish to cross." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_AV4_1" text="The small village of Zell was founded on one of the feeding tributaries of the Blue Reach. While the water here is too shallow for larger trading vessels, which are common to other rivers, the villagers use small boats and rafts to transport their crops to Fallenblatt, where it can be sold to the Halflings or transported further down river." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_AV4_2" text="Dietfurts supplies grain to the surrounding settlements as well as for the stores in Pfunzig. The villagers here are suspicious of newcomers, fearing they are halfing spies or worse; travellers from eastern Stirland. Count von Heine hires many of his troops from Dietfurts, many of whom return home when they retire, as a result the men of Dietfurts make for excellent soldiers." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.town_ST1" text="Wurtbad rests on the banks of the river Stir and it´s the capital of the province. By far the most densely populated town in Stirland, it is also home to the crumbling Temple of Myrmida. The nobility and people of Wurtbad are famous for its suspiciousness and sombreness, as the lost province of Sylvania is too close for comfort. It is one of the few places where goods can be carried over the river, making it an excellent strategic checkpoint for anyone wishing to push onwards into the land." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST1_1" text="Biberhof lies surrounded by thick forest just a few kilometers south of Wurtbad. Its inhabitants have become quite skilled in the use of the axe, both to harvest high quality wood from the old trees around it and defending their camps from vermin and the occasional highwayman. The timber from Biderhof is sought after by the nobility of Wurtbad, as it is said its dark hues is anathema to any vampire unlucky enough to be skewed by a stake made from this wood." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST1_2" text="Julbach is located halfway between River Stir and River Aver. It sits in a valley shadowed by the Zaya hills where sheep roam freely along Nuln road. The Nattern Forest, a few miles to the West, serves as both a source of wealth and superstition, as even in the coldest nights of winter, when both insect and beast sleep, a rumble of hooves can be heard in the distance." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST1_3" text="Oberwil is a small fishing village a few miles West of Wurtbad. The routes to Oberwil are little more than footpaths, as most trade and travel is done via river. The village is somewhat protected by the Riverwardens who frequent the Stir, but villagers generally have to fend for themselves against bandits and beastmen from the dark forest." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST1_4" text="Tarshof is situated on the Northern edge of the Stirhügel hills. The village enjoys plenty of traffic from traders travelling between Wurtbad and Wörden along the Old Dwarf Road. As a result almost every house in the village professes to be an Inn, although the hospitality varies wildly and travellers are as likely to find themselves sleeping on a pile of hay as a proper pallet bed." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_ST1" text="Flensburg is a small market town nestled in the Zaya Hills to the West of the Stirhügel. The hills are perfect for sheep grazing, and the town’s economy is based on fleece, lamb and mutton. The town is also noted in the region for having a major temple of Shallya." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_ST1_1" text="Lochen is a subsidiary settlement of the nearby town Flensburg. The village mostly consists of farmers who supply the market town with grain. Lochen falls under the protection of Countess Petra Harden and her troops." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_ST2" text="Franzen is a somewhat unremarkable town, sitting in the shadow of large settlements nearby. It has a healthy fishing trade from the Lammer and the Aver, and also boasts a well-used ferry across the Lammer which allows travellers to continue the road West to Russbach." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_ST2_1" text="Chrobok is a small farming community situated in the low wetlands between the rivers Mattid, Lammer and Aver. The natural irrigation provided by the rivers has made the region perfect arable land, and the nearby Franzen and Averheim enjoy a bountiful supply of grain from the village." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_ST2_2" text="Russbach is a hamlet situated in the sodden fens to the South of the Stirhügel hills. Just beneath the surface of the earth are deep clay pits, and the people of Russbach make a living by mining the building material. Travellers know they’re near the village when they can smell the acrid smoke of the brickmakers’ kilns." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_ST3" text="Halstedt Keep is on the South-East edge of the Stirhügel hills and is a staging point for the Roadwardens of the region. Originally it was a manor house belonging to some long forgotten lord, over time it has become more fortified as each subsequent owner has sought to protect its inhabitants against bandits and the greenskins from nearby Altern Forest. Eventually it fell into state hands, and was turned into a fortress lodge for the official Roadwardens who protect the locale." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_ST3_1" text="Raab is a village which formed naturally around a Shallyan Shrine. Situated at the confluence of many roads, it was a natural place for a roadside shrine - a place for travellers to stop, rest and ask for blessings on their journey. One day a wine merchant who frequented the shrine realised the value of such easy custom, and built an Inn at the crossroads. It wasn’t long until a community had built up around it, and the village of Raab was formed." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_ST3_2" text="Tenneck is a village of vintners who supply the local Roadwarden stronghold at Halstedt Keep. Tennech formed from the families of bondmen who tended to the grounds and nobles living at Halstedt Manor. When Halstedt Manor was turned into Halstedt Keep, they were made into freemen, and decided to cultivate their land for selling fruit and drink. The Roadwardens of Halstedt Keep often accept a few gallons of wine a month in exchange for keeping the people of Tenneck safe." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.town_ST2" text="Amongst the Haunted Hills by the source of the Black Run River, lies the small town of Leicheberg. The people here live in constant fear of its neighbour to the east, Sylvania. Its ruler, Count Petr von Stolpe, has faced the Undead many times in his life and takes many measures to prepare for their return. Many witch hunters and vampire hunters have taken up residence here as a result. The town is notable for hosting a far larger temple and Garden of Morr than the number of inhabitants would otherwise require, for Count von Stolpe feels it is his obligation to ensure proper burials for all who die in his demesne." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST2_1" text="Swartzhafen is a small village notable for its history. A great battle was fought here almost five hundred years prior, the ruins of a castle and the old village to the east of the settlement purportedly all that physically remains of that conflict. The modern village is prosperous, but wary of outsiders due to its situation near Sylvania." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST2_2" text="Naubonum is a small village right on the border of Sylvania. The people here get by mostly by raising crops to feed themselves, with any other goods purchased through the sale of excess crops or labour. Situated near the Haunted Hills, the inhabitants are often worried about outsiders from the east, Spectres and foul creatures. The Halfling Fieldwardens are known to stop in the settlement from time to time while patrolling the eastern reaches of the Moot." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST2_3" text="The small town of Bylorhof has recently reentered the fold of the holy after throwing off their Sylvanian overlords. The cult of Bylorak, God of the marshes west of town, is the predominant belief of the inhabitants and Bylorak’s priests have taken charge of the town and its affairs, seeking greater support and reintegration with Stirland. There are four small temples in the town dedicated to Bylorak, Morr, Sigmar and Shallya respectively. The old lords castle lies in ruins to the west of town, right next to the Bylorhof Marshes." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.town_ST3" text="On the border of traditional Sylvania lies the town of Siegfriedhof. Nestled between the Hunger Wood’s fringes and the Svarsee, it has historically commanded a strategic position in the Eschenstir basin. The town is overseen by the High and Chivalric Order of Deserved Rest, better known as the Raven Knights, whose Grandmaster personally sees to the protection of the people here. Stewardship over Siegfriedhof was granted to the Morrian templars by the Elector Count of Stirland, in gratitude for the Order's contribution in the Battle of Hel Fenn, 400 years prior. The town is also the site of the Abbey of Blessed Aethelbert the Vigilant. Due to the significant cult presence of the Morrians, Siegfriedhof is often used as a staging area for agents to keep watch over Sylvania. The people of Siegfriedhof are quite suspicious of strangers, and preemptive lynchings of unknown travellers have been known to occur." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST3_1" text="A prosperous forest village situated between the Hunger Wood and the Svarsee, the people here at Sterniste make most of their wealth from cutting the local timber and floating it up the Eschenstir to Siegfriedof for market. The people here are very devoted to Morr, having often called upon the Raven Knights to defend them from Goblins and other dangers of the nearby woods or threats from even farther afield." />

The town is a modest one, the people here are very aware of their precarious position between Black Fire Pass and Sylvania, as such the town is decently fortified in preparation for these threats. The temples of Sigmar and Taal are well consecrated, and the Garden of Morr has a protective curtain wall around it. Many pilgrims on their way to take the trek up to the final temple of Skaranorak stop in Mittlenburg to purchase supplies." />

The people here make most of their living out of cultivating the hilly land surrounding their town, supplemented with what ore they can scrape out of the earth. Most travellers and their goods are welcomed in Kaunitz and Dwarfs often pass through here on their travels out of the mountains and into the wider Empire. However the people are wary of queer folk and will not hesitate to run a Strigany camp or other such rubbish out of their home." />

The rough terrain makes expansion near impossible, but the intersection of the Old Dwarf Road and the Prager strasse makes passing along viable; not that it matters, as no outsider finds kindness in Wörden.

The indomitable Dwarfs persisted however. Despite many losses they slew the wicked Countess within Castle Templehof.

Nuln is a centre for trade, as the trade from Southern Wissenland and Solland, Averland, as well as trade that comes through Blackfire pass or the Grey and Black Mountains must first pass through Nuln before reaching the rest of the Empire.. Nuln has served as the capital of the Empire for long periods of time and has historically received the support needed to truly become a metropolis. It is also the religious capital in the south for the Sigmarite Church, overseeing Wissenland, Stirland and Averland. The Elector-Countess of all of Wissenland makes her court here, while the provincial capitol remains in Wissenberg, she much prefers the comfort of Nuln to the ‘Po-faced Boughers’ of the Assembly of Wissenland." />
		<string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.town_WI2" text="Pfeildorf, meaning 'arrow town' in Menogothic Reikspiel is the former capital of the destroyed Grand Province of Solland. The city has had a long and troubled history, and as such a visitor can feel the burden of time on the shoulders of its inhabitants. Once Pfeildorf was as grand a city as Wissenburg and Solland as rich a province as Averland or Stirland. After an Orc invasion in the early 18th century killed off most of the nobility and sent the majority of its population into flight, Pfeildorf and the former province was informally split between Wissenland and Averland. Emperor Magnus the Pious in the 24th century attempted to restore Solland, defining its borders with Averland and Wissenland and reconstituting it as the Grand Barony of Solland. However, Solland still remains heavily intertwined with Wissenland and despite several legal agreements is in reality a part of Wissenland. Today Pfeildorf is the centre for the Sudenland wool trade, founded along the waters where the upper Reik and the River Soll meet enables the city to be a natural place for local wool and dwarf trade from the southern grey mountains to be loaded onto ships destined for Nuln and farther." />

Thanks to its ties to Karak Norn, the city has a near unlimited supply of silver ore and some of the best Silversmiths in the southern empire and many Grey Mountain Craft-Dwarfs are found here. Its river port is the largest port on the length of the river Soll, and it serves as the focal point of all trade heading north from a large region south of the city. As a result, the Silversmiths’ Guild here is extremely wealthy and influential. The Guild does most of their business out of the dwarf constructed and fortified Guildhaus, which is said to be where the guild stores most of its silver ingots for later use by its members. Meissenburger silverwork is notable enough that occasionally the town plays host to Elector-Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz, who never fails to purchase the best of what is on offer at the time." />

While this famous beer company was destroyed by a goblin horde, its memory goes on in the minds of those who can remember its taste. Wursterburg mourns this disgrace to the art of Brewery, yet the town remains important as a centre of trade and as one of the only ferries across the River Soll.

Many hunters, trappers and woodcutters make their residence here and during the day will go north into the Reikwald to make their living. The Southern Reikwald is known for being particularly infested with monsters and ne'er do wells.

Unlike in Altdorf or Nuln, the people here have no time for poetic or flowery expressions. Most of the citizens work the various temples in the city into their daily routine, picking one each day and paying their respect if only for a few minutes, allowing them to pay respect to most of the principal gods each week. Wissenburg is also the last stop for river trade on the upper Reik before Nuln and is surrounded by good farmland. Elector-Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz seldom journeys to Wissenburg, coming only to meet the ‘po-faced boughers’ which sit on the Assembly of Wissenland.

The city itself is built within a huge shallow crater called the Taalbaston, which is many miles across, whose outer edge formed a large rocky rim and a natural wall. This wall has been built up and fortified with many tall gun towers and effectively marks the boundary of the city itself. The land inside is extensive and includes fertile farmlands, a lake filled with fresh water as well as the grand city itself, ensuring that should a mighty enemy be able to breach through Talabecland's armies, so long as the enemy is held back by the great crater walls, the city and its proud people can withstand the onslaught of siege almost indefinitely. The River Talabec flows around the outside of the crater, and where it flows past the north-eastern edge of the wall, there is a fortified Imperial town known as Taalagrad and a deep harbour from which lies the river fleets. The largest of Talabheim’s temples is dedicated to Taal and to a lesser extent Rhya.

Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short.
