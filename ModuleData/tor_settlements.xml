The site upon which the modern city now lies has been occupied since before the time of Sigmar when the Averlanders were still called Brigrundians. The dockyards here are particularly bustling due to the Aver serving as the primary trade route for the Halfling goods from the Moot into the wider empire. The bluff that the city sits upon protects the inhabitants from occasional flooding and has always served as an ideal crossing point across the Aver River; making the Griffin bridge one of the only places for many miles which provides access across the river for merchants and travellers heading north into Stirland or south into Averland. The skyline of the city is dominated by the Averburg Palace, a formidable fortress originally built around the founding of the Empire; views of the surrounding lands from the palace go for several miles all around the city. The city is famous for its cattle stockyards, the final destination of thousands of Averland cattle, the Plenzerplatz and of course its lord; Marious Lietdorf, the mad count of Averland.">

The university continues to operate with the memory of the purge following the Alptraum’s violent suppression still fresh in most residents’ minds.

Stewardship over Siegfriedhof was granted to the Morrian templars by the Elector Count of Stirland, in gratitude for the Order's contribution in the Battle of Hel Fenn, 400 years prior. The town is also the site of the Abbey of Blessed Aethelbert the Vigilant.

The city has had a long and troubled history, and as such a visitor can feel the burden of time on the shoulders of its inhabitants. Once Pfeildorf was as grand a city as Wissenburg and Solland as rich a province as Averland or Stirland. After an Orc invasion in the early 18th century killed off most of the nobility and sent the majority of its population into flight, Pfeildorf and the former province was informally split between Wissenland and Averland. Emperor Magnus the Pious in the 24th century attempted to restore Solland, defining its borders with Averland and Wissenland and reconstituting it as the Grand Barony of Solland. However, Solland still remains heavily intertwined with Wissenland and despite several legal agreements is in reality a part of Wissenland. Today Pfeildorf is the centre for the Sudenland wool trade, founded along the waters where the upper Reik and the River Soll meet enables the city to be a natural place for local wool and dwarf trade from the southern grey mountains to be loaded onto ships destined for Nuln and farther.">

Its river port is the largest port on the length of the river Soll, and it serves as the focal point of all trade heading north from a large region south of the city. As a result, the Silversmiths’ Guild here is extremely wealthy and influential. The Guild does most of their business out of the dwarf constructed and fortified Guildhaus, which is said to be where the guild stores most of its silver ingots for later use by its members. Meissenburger silverwork is notable enough that occasionally the town plays host to Elector-Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz, who never fails to purchase the best of what is on offer at the time.">

Many hunters, trappers and woodcutters make their residence here and during the day will go north into the Reikwald to make their living. The Southern Reikwald is known for being particularly infested with monsters and ne'er do wells. As a result the ruler of Grissenwald, Count Bruno Pfeifraucher, is a professional military man who is often seen leading a patrol around his town to keep the forest’s dangers at bay.">

In Steingart, the oppressive air that hangs around the Sollanders is the heaviest, as if they’d be happier if they could just forget their former grandeur. To the south of Steingart is a set of ancient standing stones, commonly called ‘Taal’s Fangs.’ This name is in spite of the insistence of the cult of Taal that the site is not Taalite in origin.

Unfortunately, the upper Reik is known to change its course regularly and leagues are no longer used in the Empire in favour of the Imperial Mile. The fertile, well watered grasslands of the Oggeland is greatly desired by both the Wissenland Sheep Herders, and the Averland Cattle Ranchers; brawls or even ‘battles’ have been known to commence between the two groups. Rancher and Herder alike have petitioned their lords to settle this dispute, with the sword if need be.">

Talabheim lies deep within the Great Forest of the Empire, and as such earned its name as the Eye of the Forest, like the eye of a mighty storm, the crater being an island of calm amidst the surrounding danger. The city itself is built within a huge shallow crater called the Taalbaston, which is many miles across, whose outer edge formed a large rocky rim and a natural wall. This wall has been built up and fortified with many tall gun towers and effectively marks the boundary of the city itself. The land inside is extensive and includes fertile farmlands, a lake filled with fresh water as well as the grand city itself, ensuring that should a mighty enemy be able to breach through Talabecland's armies, so long as the enemy is held back by the great crater walls, the city and its proud people can withstand the onslaught of siege almost indefinitely. The River Talabec flows around the outside of the crater, and where it flows past the north-eastern edge of the wall, there is a fortified Imperial town known as Taalagrad and a deep harbour from which lies the river fleets. The largest of Talabheim’s temples is dedicated to Taal and to a lesser extent Rhya. Even though the primary place of Taal’s worship continues to be the Sacred Forest, worshippers who live within the confines of the city value an opportunity to seek spiritual enlightenment without making a trip to the other end of the crater.">

This has greatly strained resources and fights between locals and refugees are common and increasing in size.

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

While trade flows through the town from the canals to itself and from the Reik to its north, Grünburg’s main source of wealth comes from its river boatyards, where many of the boats and barges that ply the rivers of the Reikland originate from. The town is also famous for the Battle of Grünburg where the advance of Orc Warlord Gorbad Ironclaw was finally halted around a half a millenia ago. The battle plains is valued particularly due to the fact that nearly all of the Imperial and orc forces present were mounted calvarymen, unusual for both the contemporary period and the modern era. As such an excavation site has been established by several interested parties and many come to look upon their work.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old WoHLd. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

Ruled by Margrave Reinhardt von Mackensen, the fortress town serves as both the economic and military border between Bretonnia and the Empire. Axe Bite is one of three mountain passes through the Grey mountains; as such the safety of passage through it is a primary concern. Helmgart itself is a market town, surrounded by several curtain walls. One of these walls traverses the entire width of the pass itself, meaning all travel must pass through its single gate or be stuck on either the Bretonnian or Imperial side of the border.">

Emperor Karl Franz rules both the Grand Principality of the Reikland and the Empire of Sigmar from this sprawling city, and what better a capital than the city founded by Sigmar himself two and a half millennia ago? Besides for its history, Altdorf is geographically the focal point of trade for three quarters of the Empire; for here all of the goods and travel from the states of Ostermark, Talabecland, Hochland, Stirland, Wissenland and Averland must go before they can move down the Reik to Marienburg and beyond. The city also hosts numerous knightly orders, the center of the Sigmarite church and the eight Imperial colleges of magic. Despite this prosperity and importance, Altdorf is a restless city: overpopulated and ripe for political violence, much of the fair city and its services have been pushed to their limits.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

Besides for its history, Altdorf is geographically the focal point of trade for three quarters of the Empire; for here all of the goods and travel from the states of Ostermark, Talabecland, Hochland, Stirland, Wissenland and Averland must go before they can move down the Reik to Marienburg and beyond. The city also hosts numerous knightly orders, the center of the Sigmarite church and the eight Imperial colleges of magic.

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

Eilhart wine is one of the Reiklands best wines, valued for its crisp light flavours and its mild hangovers. Eilhart is a destination for riverboat cruises, where wealthy merchants and nobles from Altdorf often come up the river to taste the various local vintages and foods. Many of the people here are said to have bretonnian heritage, visitors often comment on the similar bone structure shared by many of the inhabitants.">

Surrounded by deep chasms, it is  a key fortress city in holding off any enemies from the Grey Mountains and beyond, from reaching central Bretonnia. Due to the location, many Dwarf families have flocked to Parravon. It is also notable for being the only place in Bretonnia where peasants can live in Stone houses. This is due to a trick of legal language; the homes the peasants carve out of the rock of Les Monts Seuls are considered ‘Caves’ and thus are not prohibited.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

The duel never happened, as the two knights were about to clash their steel a horde of zombies befell them. It is said that the zombies were defeated by a group of adventurers, but they never returned, and neither did any group that was sent to investigate. The local duke, the only living relative of Lord Gransette, has taken up residence after a substantial cleansing of the castle, despite this, the castle staff reports that the castle is still haunted, hearing footsteps and moans around corners. It was even reported by the groundskeeper, that on one fateful night, he saw the apparitions of Sir Gaseric and Lord Gransette duelling each other, still fighting for their long lost love.">

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

While trade flows through the town from the canals to itself and from the Reik to its north, Grünburg’s main source of wealth comes from its river boatyards, where many of the boats and barges that ply the rivers of the Reikland originate from. The town is also famous for the Battle of Grünburg where the advance of Orc Warlord Gorbad Ironclaw was finally halted around a half a millenia ago. The battle plains is valued particularly due to the fact that nearly all of the Imperial and orc forces present were mounted calvarymen, unusual for both the contemporary period and the modern era. As such an excavation site has been established by several interested parties and many come to look upon their work.">
