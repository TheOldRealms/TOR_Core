The site upon which the modern city now lies has been occupied since before the time of Sigmar when the Averlanders were still called Brigrundians. The dockyards here are particularly bustling due to the Aver serving as the primary trade route for the Halfling goods from the Moot into the wider empire. The bluff that the city sits upon protects the inhabitants from occasional flooding and has always served as an ideal crossing point across the Aver River; making the Griffin bridge one of the only places for many miles which provides access across the river for merchants and travellers heading north into Stirland or south into Averland. The skyline of the city is dominated by the Averburg Palace, a formidable fortress originally built around the founding of the Empire; views of the surrounding lands from the palace go for several miles all around the city. The city is famous for its cattle stockyards, the final destination of thousands of Averland cattle, the Plenzerplatz and of course its lord; Marious Lietdorf, the mad count of Averland.">

It is one of the few places where goods can be carried over the river, making it an excellent strategic checkpoint for anyone wishing to push onwards into the land.">

Nestled between the Hunger Wood’s fringes and the Svarsee, it has historically commanded a strategic position in the Eschenstir basin. The town is overseen by the High and Chivalric Order of Deserved Rest, better known as the Raven Knights, whose Grandmaster personally sees to the protection of the people here. Stewardship over Siegfriedhof was granted to the Morrian templars by the Elector Count of Stirland, in gratitude for the Order's contribution in the Battle of Hel Fenn, 400 years prior. The town is also the site of the Abbey of Blessed Aethelbert the Vigilant. Due to the significant cult presence of the Morrians, Siegfriedhof is often used as a staging area for agents to keep watch over Sylvania. The people of Siegfriedhof are quite suspicious of strangers, and preemptive lynchings of unknown travellers have been known to occur.">

Built shortly after the defeat of Vlad von Carstein in the siege of Altdorf during one of the great Vampire wars of 2010 IC. However, many centuries later after neglect and lack of manpower the fortress was easily taken by Konrad von Carstein. Though the Empire reclaimed the fort it was taken again many years later by Mannfred von Carstein. Who put a terrible curse on the fort. Whenever it is sieged the wrathful specters of past wars rise to kill any and all who threaten the fort. Those spirits lay claim to the fort. And the Empire has been unsuccessful at reclaiming it since.">

The city has had a long and troubled history, and as such a visitor can feel the burden of time on the shoulders of its inhabitants. Once Pfeildorf was as grand a city as Wissenburg and Solland as rich a province as Averland or Stirland. After an Orc invasion in the early 18th century killed off most of the nobility and sent the majority of its population into flight, Pfeildorf and the former province was informally split between Wissenland and Averland. Emperor Magnus the Pious in the 24th century attempted to restore Solland, defining its borders with Averland and Wissenland and reconstituting it as the Grand Barony of Solland. However, Solland still remains heavily intertwined with Wissenland and despite several legal agreements is in reality a part of Wissenland. Today Pfeildorf is the centre for the Sudenland wool trade, founded along the waters where the upper Reik and the River Soll meet enables the city to be a natural place for local wool and dwarf trade from the southern grey mountains to be loaded onto ships destined for Nuln and farther.">

Thanks to its ties to Karak Norn, the city has a near unlimited supply of silver ore and some of the best Silversmiths in the southern empire and many Grey Mountain Craft-Dwarfs are found here. Its river port is the largest port on the length of the river Soll, and it serves as the focal point of all trade heading north from a large region south of the city. As a result, the Silversmiths’ Guild here is extremely wealthy and influential. The Guild does most of their business out of the dwarf constructed and fortified Guildhaus, which is said to be where the guild stores most of its silver ingots for later use by its members. Meissenburger silverwork is notable enough that occasionally the town plays host to Elector-Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz, who never fails to purchase the best of what is on offer at the time.">

Unfortunately, the upper Reik is known to change its course regularly and leagues are no longer used in the Empire in favour of the Imperial Mile. The fertile, well watered grasslands of the Oggeland is greatly desired by both the Wissenland Sheep Herders, and the Averland Cattle Ranchers; brawls or even ‘battles’ have been known to commence between the two groups. Rancher and Herder alike have petitioned their lords to settle this dispute, with the sword if need be.">

Talabheim lies deep within the Great Forest of the Empire, and as such earned its name as the Eye of the Forest, like the eye of a mighty storm, the crater being an island of calm amidst the surrounding danger. The city itself is built within a huge shallow crater called the Taalbaston, which is many miles across, whose outer edge formed a large rocky rim and a natural wall. This wall has been built up and fortified with many tall gun towers and effectively marks the boundary of the city itself. The land inside is extensive and includes fertile farmlands, a lake filled with fresh water as well as the grand city itself, ensuring that should a mighty enemy be able to breach through Talabecland's armies, so long as the enemy is held back by the great crater walls, the city and its proud people can withstand the onslaught of siege almost indefinitely. The River Talabec flows around the outside of the crater, and where it flows past the north-eastern edge of the wall, there is a fortified Imperial town known as Taalagrad and a deep harbour from which lies the river fleets. The largest of Talabheim’s temples is dedicated to Taal and to a lesser extent Rhya. Even though the primary place of Taal’s worship continues to be the Sacred Forest, worshippers who live within the confines of the city value an opportunity to seek spiritual enlightenment without making a trip to the other end of the crater.">

This has greatly strained resources and fights between locals and refugees are common and increasing in size. Count von Behring was an early supporter of Elector Count Feuerbach, and now he expects help in return. Feuerbach has sent a troop of his personal guard to Bek to maintain order, but rumours say that there will soon be a larger force arriving with instructions to invade Ostland “to restore order and allow the refugees to return home.” Order under whose rule is the open question.">

The city also hosts numerous knightly orders, the center of the Sigmarite church and the eight Imperial colleges of magic.

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

Besides for its history, Altdorf is geographically the focal point of trade for three quarters of the Empire; for here all of the goods and travel from the states of Ostermark, Talabecland, Hochland, Stirland, Wissenland and Averland must go before they can move down the Reik to Marienburg and beyond.

By road it lies between Eilhart and Schilderheim. The town's primary trade good is the Holthusen Hogshead barrel which is used across the empire to age or ferment their products before shipment. The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute. This dubious practice likely will not be allowed to continue much longer.">

The city is home to two major holy sites in the realm, the First Chapel of Castle Bordeleaux, the most sacred Grail Chapel in the kingdom; and the Temple of Manaan, of which some say rivals even the temple in Marienburg.">

Emperor Karl Franz rules both the Grand Principality of the Reikland and the Empire of Sigmar from this sprawling city, and what better a capital than the city founded by Sigmar himself two and a half millennia ago? Besides for its history, Altdorf is geographically the focal point of trade for three quarters of the Empire; for here all of the goods and travel from the states of Ostermark, Talabecland, Hochland, Stirland, Wissenland and Averland must go before they can move down the Reik to Marienburg and beyond. The city also hosts numerous knightly orders, the center of the Sigmarite church and the eight Imperial colleges of magic. Despite this prosperity and importance, Altdorf is a restless city: overpopulated and ripe for political violence, much of the fair city and its services have been pushed to their limits.">

Emperor Karl Franz rules both the Grand Principality of the aquitaine and the vlandia of Sigmar from this sprawling city, and what better a capital than the city founded by Sigmar himself two and a half millennia ago? Besides for its history, Altdorf is geographically the focal point of trade for three quarters of the vlandia; for here all of the goods and travel from the states of Ostermark, Talabecland, Hochland, Stirland, Wissenland and Averland must go before they can move down the Reik to Marienburg and beyond. The city also hosts numerous knightly orders, the center of the Sigmarite church and the eight Imperial colleges of magic. Despite this prosperity and importance, Altdorf is a restless city: overpopulated and ripe for political violence, much of the fair city and its services have been pushed to their limits.">
