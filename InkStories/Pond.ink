===Start===

    As your party is traveling you come across a tranquil scene that steals your breath away. Before you stretches a serene pond, a hidden gem amidst the wilderness. The water is calm and clear, reflecting the azure sky above. Lush vegetation surrounds the pond, offering a peaceful sanctuary.
    {IsNight(): Silver moonlight | Golden sunlight} filters through the trees, casting a glow on the water's surface. The air carries the gentle scent of nature, a soothing balm for your weary senses. Birds sing melodious tunes, contributing to the serene atmosphere.

    As you stand there, captivated by the sight, your men catch up to you. Their faces, etched with exhaustion, light up with wonder and relief. Even the typically reserved member of your group manages a small smile.
    
    Your second places a hand on your shoulder, their voice carrying a rare note of lightness. "A moment of respite by the pond. What do you say?"
