===START===
At the end of the days march, your men are setting up camp. You know sunset will come soon, and these lands are dangerous, especially at night. #STR_Start1
Suddenly, one of your men shouts a warning. Glancing up, you see a local villager approaching. He appears to be unarmed. #illustration: stranger #STR_Start2
The man explains that a recently arrived necromancer has started raising the dead from the village cemetery. Although the village is quite poor, he says they will pay a modest reward to anyone who slays the necromancer. #STR_Start3
